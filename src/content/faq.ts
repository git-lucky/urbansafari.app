    q: 'How big can a team be?',

    q: 'Which cities do you run in?',
    a: 'Any walkable city your team is in. Tell us where and when, and we\'ll scout the route, build the challenges, and turn your city into the game board.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can we customize the game for our company?',
    a: 'Every game is custom built for your city. No two expeditions are the same. If you book the Urban Safari package, you can also layer in company branding: custom challenges, branded moments, and content written around your team.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How far out should we book?',
    a: 'For Scout and Remote Expedition, a couple of weeks is usually enough. For Guided Expedition or a fully custom Urban Safari, two to four weeks gives us room to scout the city, build the challenges, and make the day feel effortless for you.',

    q: 'What is a Tech Captain?',
    a: 'One teammate who drives the app for the group: inviting team members, submitting challenges, and managing team settings. Everyone else on the team can still pitch in from their own device.',

  {
    q: 'Can we play on multiple devices?',
    a: 'Yep. Every teammate can use their own phone. If you need to reinstall or hop devices, your rejoin code gets you right back to your team.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why won\'t my photo or video upload?',
    a: 'Probably a weak signal. Big video files take longer, so stay on the page while it works. If it still won\'t go, quit and reopen the app; submissions are saved locally and will finish uploading when you\'re back online.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How are points scored?',
    a: 'Every challenge has a point value on its card. Complete it cleanly and you earn those points. Some creative challenges award bonus points, and hosts decide based on effort and originality.',

    q: 'The app wants camera access. Is that required?',
