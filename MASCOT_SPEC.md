# Atlas — Mascot Spec

Atlas is the Urban Safari elephant. A cute, round, bipedal little expedition buddy who shows up across the site in different poses, each tied to a specific moment in the customer journey. Inspiration reference: the way PostHog uses their hedgehog — a recurring cast member, not wallpaper.

This doc is the source of truth for every Atlas pose the site expects. The site already renders placeholders (dashed-circle boxes with the pose slug baked in). When real illustrations are ready, drop a file at `website/public/mascot/{slug}.svg` (or `.png`) and update `src/components/Mascot.astro` to swap the placeholder for an `<img>` tag.

**Generating the art:** copy-paste-ready Nano Banana Pro prompts for each pose live in `MASCOT_PROMPTS.md`. Use those with a reference image of Atlas to get consistent output across all 13 poses.

## Style guide

The canonical reference for Atlas's look is `public/mascot/atlas-cartographer.png` — every other pose should match its proportions, palette, and render style.

- **Character:** a cute bipedal cartoon elephant — Atlas stands upright on two short legs in every default pose, not on all fours. Chibi proportions: oversized round head, round belly, short stubby arms/legs, a single expressive trunk used like a hand, small pointed tail with a tiny tuft.
- **Face:** big round expressive eyes with visible white sparkle catchlights (no small bead eyes), warm open-mouth smile with a small pink tongue usually visible, optional subtle cheek blush.
- **Ears:** large, leaf-shaped, with a dusty-rose pink inner fill. Ears are the primary expression tool — one up = curious, both forward = excited, one drooped = unsure.
- **Body surface:** smooth — **no geometric, mandala, lattice, or patterned textures anywhere on the body or ears**. That direction belonged to the old branding and is retired. The body reads as solid cell-shaded color.
- **Body color:** a gentle cool blend — mint-teal (`#8CC9C4`) on head and upper back, sky-blue (`#A3BDD9`) through the middle, lavender (`#A89BCC`) on the lower body, legs, and trunk tip. Cool purple (`#7B6FA3`) is used sparingly as the shadow tone. Belly reads slightly cooler/paler than the body. No hard bands — the transition is a soft blend.
- **Render:** soft cartoon illustration with gentle two-tone cell shading (one base + one slightly darker cool shadow tone per form), plus small cool highlights on top of head and shoulders. Not flat-only, not 3D, not photorealistic, not anime.
- **Outline:** clean deep plum-ink outline (~1.5–2px equivalent) in `#2A2239`. Consistent but not a thick stamp.
- **Shadow:** one soft, slightly offset drop shadow under the figure (4px right + 4px down, lightly blurred, cool dark neutral).
- **Props:** rendered with the same outline weight as the body, same cell-shading treatment. Brand-palette accents (gold, forest, sunset, moss, cream, sand) so Atlas stays visually tied to the site.
- **Whitespace:** each pose is composed to fit within a square aspect ratio with breathing room around the figure. The site crops to circle/square frames — we don't want props clipped.
- **Keep them flexible:** every pose should read at 48×48 px (nav/footer) all the way up to 500×500 px (hero).

Avoid: four-legged stances, small bead eyes, mandala/geometric body patterns, hard color bands, over-rendered 3D, airbrush gradients, stock mascot clichés (thumbs-up, peace signs, winking, heart eyes).

## Outfit system

Atlas has a **tan safari jacket** as a signature piece — not a uniform worn on every pose, but a signal that he's in full Safari mode. Think of it the way PostHog uses accessories on their hedgehog: a recognizable identity layer that appears when it fits the moment.

The jacket is a short, slightly oversized field/safari jacket in sand `#EDDFC3` with a forest `#1F3A2B` outline and small flap chest pockets. Collar open, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Cell-shaded to match the body treatment.

**Wear the jacket:**

| Pose | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `atlas-cartographer` / `atlas-cartographer-outfit` | Hero anchor — this is the definitive dressed Atlas |
| `atlas-flag` | Guide/leader role fits the jacket |
| `atlas-clapper` | Director energy — jacket + beret works |
| `atlas-binoculars` | Explorer mode |
| `atlas-lost` | Jacket disheveled for humor — optional |

**No jacket:**

| Pose | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `atlas-running` | Movement reads cleaner without it |
| `atlas-trophy` | Celebratory — prop is the whole costume |
| `atlas-waving` | Footer/nav tiny size — detail disappears |
| `atlas-headset` | The headset IS the costume |
| `atlas-phone` | Casual, warm, everyday |
| `atlas-booking` | Functional — prop tells the story |
| `atlas-wrench` | Tool belt is the costume |
| `atlas-laughing-together` | Spontaneous warmth — no outfit needed |

## Adding a new pose

1. Add an entry to this file (slug + description + where it's used + vibe).
2. Use it in a component via `<Mascot pose="atlas-newpose" size="md" />`.
3. When the illustration arrives, drop it at `public/mascot/atlas-newpose.svg` and update `src/components/Mascot.astro` to map the slug to the asset.

## Audit

Run this from `website/` to confirm every `Mascot` usage in the codebase has a corresponding entry here:

```sh
grep -rEoh 'pose="[a-z0-9-]+"' src | sort -u
```

Compare that list to the slugs in this document.
